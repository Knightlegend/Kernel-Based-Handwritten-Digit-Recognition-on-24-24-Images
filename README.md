# Kernel-Based-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-on-24-24-Images

Built an image recognition system to identify handwritten digits from 24×24 grayscale images using kernel-based pattern extraction.

Designed custom 4×4 kernels that sweep across the image to analyze local pixel patterns and extract meaningful spatial features.

Implemented the feature extraction and classification logic in Python, focusing on pattern recognition and spatial correlation rather than pre-trained models.

Gained hands-on understanding of convolution operations, receptive fields, and feature mapping, forming the foundation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
